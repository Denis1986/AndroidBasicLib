# AndroidBasicLib
Library contains different classes and interfaces for common problems solving, which a developer faces while creating an Android app.

## Installation

The latest release is available on [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.github.denis1986/android-base).
```groovy
implementation "io.github.denis1986:android-base:1.0.0"
```

As an alternative, you can add the library to your repository as a Git submodule and then create a dependency to the library module. 

## Structure
There are 2 modules in the project: `android-basic-lib` and `sample-app`. The former is the library itself and the latter is the sample app.

## If something is not clear or not comfortable to use
If it is not clear how to use one of the library classes or interfaces or you see that some class is not comfortable enough to use, don't hesitate to create an issue. 

May be you'll find out that not all library features are covered in a sample app - again, please, create an issue.
